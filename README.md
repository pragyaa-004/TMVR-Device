🧠 Introduction
This project introduces a novel Transcatheter Mitral Valve Replacement (TMVR) device as a minimally invasive alternative to open-heart surgery. The device addresses key challenges such as device dislodgement, paravalvular leak, and LVOT obstruction through a dual-anchorage mechanism.

Mitral stenosis (MS), particularly prevalent in India, demands innovative and safer alternatives—especially for high-risk populations like women and elderly patients.

❗ Problem Statement
Current TMVR procedures suffer from:

🔄 Device dislodgement in a beating heart due to poor anchorage

💧 Paravalvular leaks (PVL) around implanted valves

📏 Size & delivery system limitations

🚫 Left Ventricular Outflow Tract Obstruction (LVOTO)

💡 Proposed Solution: Dynamically Adaptable Anchor Mechanism
We propose a transcatheter valve system with:

⚙ Dual anchorage for stability

🪶 Self-expanding nitinol mesh

🔁 Repositionable and re-capturable design

📡 Transseptal approach for minimal invasiveness

🔬 Key Innovations
🧷 Dual Anchorage: Superior stability inside the mitral annulus

🌸 Lotus-Petal Mesh: Reduces blood flow obstruction

🔩 Dual Filament Mitral Clamps: Enhanced mitral annular grip

🧬 Nitinol Valve: Ensures flexibility and biocompatibility

📍 Transseptal Delivery: Safer than transapical methods

🧱 Increased Structural Integrity: Stronger than existing valves

➕ LVOTO Risk Mitigation: Lowers outflow obstruction

🔁 Repositionable & Re-capturable: Enhances placement accuracy

📷 Imaging Compatibility: Echocardiography and fluoroscopy

⚠ No Sharp Barbs: Prevents tissue injury

💪 High Pressure Resistance: Up to 200 mmHg without dislodgement

🧩 Anatomical Adaptability: Accommodates mitral variations

📐 Design Specifications
All dimensions in millimeters (mm)

🔲 Model - Front View
Overall Height: 38.38 mm

Valve Diameter: 20 mm

Base Width: 22.14 mm

Skirt Height: 15.23 mm

Clamp Extension: 9.52 mm

🔘 Model - Bottom View

🩺 Surgical Procedure (Transseptal Approach)
The TMVR device is delivered via catheter from the right atrium, passing through the interatrial septum to reach the left atrium and implant at the mitral valve. This transseptal route significantly lowers procedural risk and recovery time.

🔭 Future Scope
🔋 Sensor Integration: Real-time valve function monitoring

🌡 Stretchable Electronics: For flow and pressure sensing

🧪 Smart Polymers: For improved clamp retraction during deployment

✅ Impact & Benefits
🧬 Biocompatible Design for long-term implantation

🛠 Durable and Repeatable system

🚫 Reduces PVL and LVOTO risks

💓 Improved Patient Outcomes through accurate placement and secure fit

🧠 Sets New Standards in TMVR design and transcatheter interventions
